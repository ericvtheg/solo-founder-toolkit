# Solo Founder Toolkit

Too often I found myself getting into the engineering weeds of something that didn't matter. This Claude Code plugin helps relentenly focus on results instead of just doing refactors or building features that are "fun" instead of meaningful.

## What It Does

The Solo Founder Toolkit extends Claude Code with tools built specifically for the indie hacker workflow:

- **Decision frameworks** - Stop overthinking, start shipping with battle-tested prioritization
- **Landing page optimization** - CRO feedback without hiring a conversion consultant
- **Build in public content** - Turn your commits into Twitter content that attracts users
- **Feature prioritization** - Know what to build next based on impact, not gut feeling

## Philosophy

We don't debate tech stacks. You already know your tools.

We focus on what solo founders actually struggle with:
- **WHAT to build** - Which features drive revenue vs nice-to-haves
- **HOW to scope it** - Ship the 80% solution, not the 100% solution
- **WHEN to ship** - Good enough today beats perfect next month

This toolkit is opinionated. It favors speed over polish, revenue over vanity metrics, and shipping over planning.

## Installation

1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Run `/plugins`
3. Select "Add from marketplace"
4. Paste: `https://github.com/ericvtheg/solo-founder-toolkit`
5. Select the `solo-founder-toolkit` plugin

## Quick Start

After installation, try these:

- `/solo-feature-ideas` - Get prioritized feature suggestions for your codebase
- `/solo-build-in-public-tweet` - Generate tweet ideas from recent commits
- Ask Claude to "review my landing page" or "help me decide what to build next"

## Who This Is For

- Solo founders building and launching products independently
- Indie hackers focused on rapid iteration and revenue
- Small teams that need to move fast without over-engineering
- Bootstrapped builders who wear multiple hats

## Who This Is NOT For

- Teams with dedicated PMs, designers, and marketing departments
- Enterprises that need committee approval for every decision
- Builders who prefer to plan for months before writing code

**Ship fast. Iterate faster. Build profitably.**
