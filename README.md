# Solo Founder Toolkit

**A Claude Code plugin for indie hackers who ship fast and iterate faster.**

You're building alone. You don't have a PM to prioritize features, a marketing team to write copy, or a CTO to sanity-check your architecture. You wear every hat, make every decision, and ship every feature.

This toolkit is your unfair advantage.

## What It Does

The Solo Founder Toolkit extends Claude Code with tools built specifically for the indie hacker workflow:

- **Automatic progress tracking** - Metrics and user feedback get logged as you work, no manual bookkeeping
- **Decision frameworks** - Stop overthinking, start shipping with battle-tested prioritization
- **Landing page optimization** - CRO feedback without hiring a conversion consultant
- **Build in public content** - Turn your commits into Twitter content that attracts users
- **Feature prioritization** - Know what to build next based on impact, not gut feeling

## Philosophy

We don't debate tech stacks. You already know your tools.

We focus on what solo founders actually struggle with:
- **WHAT to build** - Which features drive revenue vs nice-to-haves
- **HOW to scope it** - Ship the 80% solution, not the 100% solution
- **WHEN to ship** - Good enough today beats perfect next month

This toolkit is opinionated. It favors speed over polish, revenue over vanity metrics, and shipping over planning.

## Installation

1. Start a Claude Code session
2. Run `/plugins`
3. Select "Add from marketplace"
4. Paste: `https://github.com/ericvtheg/solo-founder-toolkit`
5. Select the `solo-founder-toolkit` plugin

## Quick Start

After installation, try these:

- `/solo-feature-ideas` - Get prioritized feature suggestions for your codebase
- `/solo-build-in-public-tweet` - Generate tweet ideas from recent commits
- Ask Claude to "review my landing page" or "help me decide what to build next"

## Who This Is For

- Solo founders building and launching products independently
- Indie hackers focused on rapid iteration and revenue
- Small teams that need to move fast without over-engineering
- Bootstrapped builders who wear multiple hats

## Who This Is NOT For

- Teams with dedicated PMs, designers, and marketing departments
- Enterprises that need committee approval for every decision
- Builders who prefer to plan for months before writing code

**Ship fast. Iterate faster. Build profitably.**
