# Solo Founder Toolkit Plugin

A collection of Claude Code tools designed for solo founders, indie hackers, and small teams who are shipping fast and iterating quickly.

## Features

### Auto-Documentation System

Automatically tracks metrics and user feedback mentioned in your conversations with Claude Code. No manual bookkeeping required - just talk naturally about your product progress and let the system capture what matters.

**How it works:**
1. Mention actual metrics or user feedback in conversation
2. Hook detects concrete data (ignores hypotheticals and planning)
3. Files are automatically created/updated in `docs/metrics/` and `docs/user-feedback/`
4. Review and commit changes as part of your normal git workflow

**What gets tracked:**

- **Metrics** (`docs/metrics/`):
  - Revenue: MRR, ARR, pricing changes, milestones
  - Growth: MAU, DAU, signups, conversion rates
  - Engagement: Feature usage, activation rates
  - Churn: Retention, cancellation reasons
  - Performance: Load times, uptime (user-facing)

- **User Feedback** (`docs/user-feedback/`):
  - Direct user quotes and feature requests
  - Bug reports from users
  - Testimonials and compliments
  - Churn reasons
  - Usability complaints

**Example:**

You: "We hit $5,200 MRR this month! Three enterprise customers upgraded to annual plans."

 Creates/updates `docs/metrics/revenue.md`:
```markdown
### 2025-12-21 14:32 - $5,200 MRR
Hit $5,200 MRR this month after three enterprise customers upgraded from monthly to annual billing, improving cash flow.
```

---

You: "Got an email from john@startup.com: 'Would love to see Excel export. We need to share reports with our finance team.'"

 Creates/updates `docs/user-feedback/csv-export-requests.md`:
```markdown
### 2025-12-21 14:45 - john@startup.com
> "Would love to see Excel export. We need to share reports with our finance team who doesn't use your tool."

**Context:** Mentioned in user email about reporting features
**Priority:** High - blocks enterprise deals
```

### File Organization

**Metrics** - Category-based organization:
- `docs/metrics/revenue.md` - All revenue-related metrics
- `docs/metrics/growth.md` - User growth and conversion metrics
- `docs/metrics/engagement.md` - Feature usage and activation
- `docs/metrics/churn.md` - Retention and cancellations
- Files created dynamically as needed

**User Feedback** - Topic-based organization:
- `docs/user-feedback/csv-export-requests.md` - Related feedback grouped together
- `docs/user-feedback/dashboard-performance.md` - Performance complaints
- Files created dynamically based on feedback topic
- Related feedback automatically merged (e.g., "slow dashboard" + "performance issues"  same file)

### Format Examples

**Metrics File** (`docs/metrics/revenue.md`):

## Smart Detection

The system distinguishes between actual data and planning:

** Gets Logged:**
- "We hit $5k MRR!" (actual metric)
- "User complained dashboard is slow" (actual feedback)
- "Conversion rate jumped to 12%" (actual metric)

**L Ignored:**
- "Let's aim for $10k MRR" (goal, not actual)
- "We should track MAU better" (planning)
- "Users might want dark mode" (speculation)

## Privacy & Git

- All files are created in your git repository
- **Recommended:** Review docs before committing to avoid logging sensitive data
- Files use markdown format for easy editing/review
- Optional: Add `docs/metrics/` and `docs/user-feedback/` to `.gitignore` if preferred

## Commands

### `/solo-build-in-public-tweet`
Generates 3-5 tweet ideas from recent commits for indie hacker Twitter. Analyzes last 10-15 commits and emulates the style of @levelsio and prominent builders.

### `/solo-feature-ideas`
Analyzes codebase and pitches features using LIC framework (Lift, Impact, Conviction). Identifies 3-5 high-impact feature opportunities.

## Skills

### solo-decision-framework
Helps solo founders make quick product decisions without overthinking using the LIC Rubric (Lift, Impact, Conviction). Scores options out of 15 points each with decision recommendation.

**Trigger:** "decide what to build", "prioritize features", "choose an approach", "evaluate options"

### solo-landing-page
Framework for creating and optimizing landing pages for conversion. Uses 6 Conversion Pillars (first impression, messaging, social proof, CTAs, structure, solo founder readiness).

## Philosophy

This toolkit embraces the solo founder mindset: ship fast, iterate quickly, and focus on revenue. It's opinionated about pragmatic tradeoffs and designed to help you build profitably without a team.

We assume you already know your tech stack - we focus on **WHAT to build** (which features drive revenue), **HOW to build it** (implementation approach and scope), and **WHEN to ship** (balancing quality with speed to market).

## Installation

This plugin is part of the solo-founder-toolkit repository. Install by cloning the repository and using Claude Code's plugin system.

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- Trend analysis: Monthly/quarterly summaries of metrics
- Cross-referencing: Link metrics to related user feedback
- Priority scoring: Automatic prioritization based on frequency
- Export capability: `/solo-export-insights` command for reports
- Dashboard view: Visual representation of tracked metrics
